Dictionary Attack Tool

The "Dictionary Attack Tool" is a program created by PythonPhreak designed to assist in the recovery of password-protected ZIP files. It can use a predefined list of passwords (dictionary) or dynamically generate possible passwords for a "brute force" attack.

How to Use:

Download the code to your computer and just run it.
Create a list of passwords (dictionary) or use a dynamic approach to generate possible passwords.
Run the program, providing it with the path to the ZIP file you want to crack and the wordlist file if you're using one.
The program will attempt to decrypt the ZIP file using the provided passwords.
If a correct password is found, it will be displayed, granting you access to the encrypted ZIP file.
Feel free to customize this description further based on your preferences and additional information about the program.
